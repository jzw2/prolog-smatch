* Run instructions
Get a copy of [[https://github.com/mthom/scryer-prolog][scryer prolog]], which you can download from its github releases.

(Alternatively, if you use nix, you can just do =nix develop=) and it will automatically install it for you.

Currently, the only example is "The boy want to go" from the smatch paper, which is in =boy1.txt= and =boy2.txt=.

To run this example, run

#+begin_src
?- boy1([X]), boy2([Y]), smatch(X, Y, Score).
#+end_src
